### :wave: Brief

Hello there, this is me Walid Ezzat Mandouh Shouman.

I normally use `linux` but usually `Windows` too, prefer `C` and `python` when possible, and `DSL`s in general, enjoy `vim`, didn't delve into `emacs`, and have my `k8s` on `VM`s and `ARM`s, and I'm glad to see you around.  

I rarily add content to the [blog](https://walidshouman.blogspot.com/?view=classic), but the [gists](https://gist.github.com/weshouman) are usually my way to go.
</p>

### :information_source: What's There
Interesting proof of concepts and projects ranging from [a GLCD driver](https://github.com/weshouman/glcd-project), [GSoC for Blender](https://github.com/weshouman/Blender/tree/meshdata_transfer) to even [`C++`>`python` langformer](https://github.com/weshouman/Langformy).

If you started using any of the projects for example as a template for [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/authoring/) or [acceleo](https://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/). I would be happy to know the story.
